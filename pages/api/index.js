            desc: "The University of Mumbai has decided to hold fifth-semester exams after Diwali following multiple requests from final-year students.  Previously, the tests were scheduled to begin on October 15.The Board of Examination and Evaluation, in a meeting, has decided to postpone the semester V exams till after Diwali. The students will be informed of the new examination dates before Diwali ends,” a university official said, as reported by news agency PTI.Once the authorities share the examination schedule, students will be able to download it via the official website - mu.ac.in.This comes after students from at least five city colleges complained in writing to Mumbai University that they had insufficient time and opportunity to prepare for a written exam in long-form format.According to a The Free Press Journal report, students claimed to have taken multiple-choice questions in online tests for the previous two years in a row. They, therefore, need more time to study for final exams that will also include subjective questions.",
